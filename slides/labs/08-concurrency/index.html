                    ### Ref
                    An asynchronous, concurrent mutable reference.
                    Provides safe concurrent access and modification of its content, but no functionality for synchronisation

                    ```scala
                    abstract class Ref[F[_], A] {
                      def get: F[A]
                      def set(a: A): F[Unit]
                      def modify[B](f: A => (A, B)): F[B]
                      // ... and more
                    }
                    ```

                    ### Deferred
                    Imagine that we want to represent a value,
                    that can be not available yet with ability to synchronise multiple objects accessing it.
                    ```scala
                    abstract class Deferred[F[_], A] {
                      def get: F[A]
                      def complete(a: A): F[Boolean]
                    }
                    ```
                    ---
                    Expected behavior of get:

                    * get on an empty Deferred will block until the Deferred is completed
                    * get on a completed Deferred will always immediately return its content
                    * get is cancelable and on cancelation it will unsubscribe the registered listener, an operation that's possible for as long as the Deferred value isn't complete

                    ---
                    Expected behavior of complete:

                    * complete(a) on an empty Deferred will set it to a, notify any and all readers currently blocked on a call to get and return true
                    * complete(a) on a Deferred that has already been completed will not modify its content, and will result false

                    ### Semaphore
                    Semaphore is the same concurrency primitive that you know from OS courses:
                    ```scala
                    abstract class Semaphore[F[_]] {
                      def available: F[Long]
                      def acquire: F[Unit]
                      def release: F[Unit]
                      // ... and more
                    }
                    ```
                    ---
                    * It has a non-negative number of permits available.
                    * Acquiring a permit decrements the current number of permits and releasing a permit increases the current number of permits.
                    * An acquire that occurs when there are no permits available results in semantic blocking until a permit becomes available.
                    * Semaphore acquiring can be cancelled even if it is already blocked.

                    ### Count Down Latch
                    Blocks any fibers that waits on it. Initialized with positive integer value `n`
                    and waiting fibers are semantically blocked until all `n` latches are released.
                    Can be used only once, further `await` will return `IO.unit`
                    ```scala
                    trait CountDownLatch[F[_]] {
                      def release: F[Unit]

                      def await: F[Unit]
                    }
                    ```
                    `await` can be cancelled

                    ### Cyclic Barrier
                    A re-usable synchronization primitive that allows a set of fibers to wait until they've all reached the same point.
                    ```scala
                    trait CyclicBarrier[F[_]] {
                      def await: F[Unit]
                    }
                    ```
                    Initialized with positive value `n` and waits until `n` fibers will be awaiting for release.
                    `await`:7.0.is cancellable. Barrier is reusable.
