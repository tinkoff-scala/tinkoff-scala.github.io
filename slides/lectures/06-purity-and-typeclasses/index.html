                    ## Purity & Typeclasses
                    Lecture 06

                    ---
                    ## Pure Functions

                    What is a pure function?

                    ---

                    Pure function is a function that has following properties:

                    1. It returns identical result for identical arguments
                    2. It produces no side effects

                    ---

                    Is this function pure?

                    ```scala [1-4]
                    import scala.util.Random

                    def increment1(x: Int): Int =
                      x + Random.nextInt(5)
                    ```

                    ---

                    No, it is __not__. It may produce different results for the same argument

                    ```scala [1-4]
                    val x = increment1(1)  // x = 2
                    val y = increment1(1)  // y = 3

                    println(x == y) // false
                    ```

                    ---
                    And is this function pure?

                    ```scala [1-4]
                    import scala.util.Random

                    def increment2(x: Int): Int =
                      x + (new Random(x)).nextInt(5)
                    ```

                    ---

                    - Formally, it is. It produces random but unique results.
                    - Constructor of __`Random`__ sets random seed.
                    - Seed is the same for the same argument, thus produces the same result

                    ---

                    Okay, and is this function pure?

                    ```scala [1-4]
                    def increment3(x: Int): Int = {
                      println(s"Input argument: $x")
                      x + 1
                    }
                    ```

                    ---
                    - This function satisfies the first property of purity. It produces the same result for
                    the same argument
                    - However, it violates the second property. It, in fact, produces a __side effect__.

                    ---
                    ## Side Effect

                    What is a side effect?

                    ---
                    Side effect is a modification of some (global) state outside of the local scope
                    ---

                    - We can say, that there is a global state - standard output
                    - Thus, each call of `increment3` function will modify the standard output

                    ```scala [1-4]
                    val x = increment3(1) // stdout: 1; x = 1
                    val y = increment3(1) // stdout: 1, 1; x = 1

                    println(x == y) // true
                    ```
                    ---

                    - Another example of a side effect
                    - Modification of a variable outside of a function scope

                    ```scala [1-6]
                    var result = 0

                    def increment4(x: Int): Int = {
                      result += x
                      x + 1
                    }
                    ```
                    ---

                    ## Referential Transparency

                    ---
                    The expression is called referentially transparent if the expression can be substituted with the result,
                    that is being evaluated.

                    ---
                    Example:
                    ```scala [1-11]
                    def increment5(x: Int): Int = x + 1

                    val one = increment5(1) // increment5(1) is a referentially transparent expression
                    val two = 2             // 2 is a result of increment5(1)

                    println(one == two) // true

                    val three = increment5(1) + increment5(1)
                    val four  = one + one

                    println(three == four) // true
                    ```
                    ---
                    Now let's see the example of __not__ referentially transparent expression

                    ```scala []
                    def increment6(x: Int): Int = {
                      println(x)
                      x + 1
                    }

                    // stdout: 1, 1; one = 2
                    val one = increment6(1) + increment6(1)

                    val res = increment6(1)
                    // stdout: 1; one = 2
                    val two = res + res
                    ```
                    ---

                    - The overall effect of the two calls of `increment6` and result substitute with `res` are not the same.
                    - First expression produces two writes to standard output
                    - Second expression produces only one write to standard output

                    ---

                    - Why can absence of the side effects be beneficial?
                    - Why can referentially transparent code be beneficial?
                    - Why can pure functions be beneficial?

                    ---

                    - Easy to test
                    - Easy to understand. No need to know the whole context (_local reasoning_)
                    - Easy to refactor code

                    ## Total Functions

                    ---
                    - Functions that are defined on the whole domain (on all inputs) are called __total__.
                    - In other words, for any input it will produce a result
                    ---
                    Is this function __total__?

                    ```scala [1]
                    def multiply(x: Int): Int = x * x
                    ```
                    ---

                    Yes, it is

                    ---
                    Is this function __total__?

                    ```scala [1]
                    def divide(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x / y
                    ```
                    ---

                    - No, it is __not__
                    - It will produce an __ArithmeticException__ for 1 and 0

                    ```scala [1]
                    divide(1, 0) // throws an ArithmeticException
                    ```

                    ---
                    - If function is not total, than it is __partial__
                    - Remember, Scala has separate class of functions called `PartialFunction`, which are allowed to be defined
                    on the subset of the domain
                    - However, not all __partial__ functions are __`PartialFunctions`__ (:

                    ---

                    Why can total functions be beneficial?

                    ---

                    No unexpected exceptions in the programs

                    Traditional while loops deal with mutable state:

                    ```scala [1-6]
                    var x = 0

                    while (x < 10) {
                      println(x)
                      x += 1
                    }
                    ```
                    ---

                    How in functional world can we implement traversal of collection?

                    ---
                    ## Recursion

                    ---

                    Recursion plays a big role in functional programming and helps with complex structures

                    ---
                    Let's rewrite the given example with the recursion:

                    ```scala
                    def loop(x: Int = 0): Unit =
                      if (x < 10) {
                        println(x)
                        loop(x + 1)
                      }

                    loop()
                    ```
                    ---

                    However, we are still executing on the JVM. What potential
                    problems can we have with recursive functions?

                    ---

                    - `StackOverflowException`
                    - Each recursive call will produce allocation of the new set of arguments on the stack
                    - If recursion is deep enough, we can have an overflow of the stack

                    ---

                    - How can we solve such issue?

                    ---
                    ## Tail Recursion
                    ---

                    - _Tail Recursion_ is a special kind of recursion that has as its last expression either a recursive
                    call, or a constant value
                    - It can be optimized during compilation and rewritten to the while loop

                    ---

                    Is this a tail recursion?

                    ```scala [1-2]
                    def factorial(n: Int): Int =
                      if (n < 1) 1 else n * factorial(n - 1)
                    ```

                    ---

                    - No, it is __not__. Last expression consists of multiplication and a recursive call
                    - How can we make this function tail recursive?

                    ---
                    ```scala [1-2]
                    def factorial(n: Int, acc: Int = 1): Int =
                      if (n < 1) acc else factorial(n - 1, acc * n)
                    ```
                    - We can add an internal state of the computation (__accumulator__) as a separate argument with
                    default value, that is equal to initial value.
                    - Explicitly change the state of the computation and a pass a new value in the recursive call
                    - When ready, just return an __accumulator__

                    ---

                    - However, this function still can have `StackOverflowException`, because the compiler will not optimize it
                    - We must explicitly tell the compiler to perform a tail recursive optimization through static
                    annotation:

                    ```scala
                    import scala.annotation.tailrec

                    @tailrec
                    def factorial(n: Int, acc: Int = 1): Int =
                      if (n < 1) acc else factorial(n - 1, acc * n)
                    ```
                    ---

                    The same recursive pattern can be applied to lists:
                    ```scala [1-5]
                    def sum(ints: List[Int], acc: Int = 0): Int =
                      ints match {
                        case Nil     => acc
                        case x :: xs => sum(xs, acc + x)
                      }
                    ```

                    ---
                    Now, let's generalize this pattern:

                    ```scala [1-8]
                    def general[Acc, T](list: List[T], acc: Acc)
                                       (f: (Acc, T) => Acc): Acc =
                      list match {
                        case Nil     => acc
                        case x :: xs => general(xs, f(acc, x))(f)
                      }

                    val sum = general(List(1, 2, 3), 0)(_ + _) // sum = 6
                    ```

                    ---

                    In fact, we came to

                    ## Folds
                    ---

                    - This operation can be implemented for many collections
                    - It generalizes traversal with accumulation of some state

        <section>
            <section data-markdown>
                <textarea data-template>
                    Let's recall Java-like (or OOP) pattern for adding similar behaviour:

                    ```scala
                    trait Comparable[T] {
                      def compareTo(other: T): Int
                    }

                    class User(val username: String,
                               private val rank: Int) extends Comparable[User] {
                      def compareTo(other: User): Int = this.rank - other.rank
                    }

                    (new User("Vasya", 1)).compareTo(new User("Petya", 2)) // -1
                    ```

                    ---
                    - Now, suppose we want to add implementation of `Comparable` to `TwitterUser`

                    ```scala [1-3]
                    package com.twitter

                    final class TwitterUser(val followers: Int)
                    ```

                    ---
                    - Unfortunately, we cannot implement `Comparable` for `TwitterUser` because it is final
                    - We also cannot implement `Comparable` for `Int` and `String` because they are standard

                    ---

                    How can we solve this issue?

                    ---
                    ## Typeclass

                    ---
                    _Typeclass_ is a design pattern that allows you to easily extend any closed type with new
                    behaviour

                    ---

                    - Typeclasses are expressed through simple traits with one or more type parameters
                    - Let's define typeclass analog of `Comparable`

                    ```scala [1-3]
                    trait Comparator[T] {
                      def compare(x: T, y: T): Int
                    }
                    ```

                    ---
                    - Implementations of the trait will be called _instances_ of the typeclass
                    - Implementations, usually, do not have explicit constructors

                    ```scala [1-8]
                    class ComparatorInt extends Comparator[Int] {
                      def compare(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x - y
                    }

                    class ComparatorString extends Comparator[Int] {
                      def compare(x: String, y: String): Int =
                        x.length - y.length
                    }
                    ```

                    ---
                    - We can use typeclasses to define polymorphic functions like `max` function:

                    ```scala
                    def safeMax[T](list: List[T])
                                  (comparator: Comparator[T]): Option[T] =
                        list.foldLeft[Option[T]](None) {
                          case (Some(v1), v2) =>
                            val res = comparator.compare(v1, v2) < 0
                            Some(if (res) v2 else v1)
                          case (None, v)      => Some(v)
                        }
                    ```

                    ---
                    - In order to use it, we must specify how our `T` is compared

                    ```scala
                    val list = List(1, 2, 3)
                    val res = safeMax(list)(new ComparatorInt) // res = Some(3)
                    ```
                    ---
                    - Instances of Comparator are unique for defined types
                    - We need to pass them to polymorphic functions
                    - Why don't we use implicits?

                    ```scala [1-10]
                    trait Comparator[T] {
                      def compare(x: T, y: T): Int
                    }

                    object Comparator {
                      implicit val comparatorInt: Comparator[Int] =
                        (x, y) => x - y
                      implicit val comparatorString: Comparator[String] =
                        (x, y) => x.length - y.length
                    }
                    ```

                    ---

                    ```scala [1-9]
                    def safeMax[T](list: List[T])(implicit
                      comparator: Comparator[T]
                    ): Option[T] =
                      list.foldLeft[Option[T]](None) {
                        case (Some(v1), v2) =>
                          val res = comparator.compare(v1, v2) < 0
                          Some(if (res) v2 else v1)
                        case (None, v)      => Some(v)
                      }
                    ```

                    ---
                    - Here, the actual behaviour of the `safeMax` function is defined by the provided type `T`
                    - Such polymorphism is called __ad-hoc__

                    ---

                    - There are several common adjustments to the typeclass pattern
                    - First, usage of apply summon function

                    ```scala [1-7]
                    object Comparator {
                      // works identically to `implicitly`
                      def apply[T](implicit
                        comparator: Comparator[T]
                      ): Comparator[T] = comparator
                      //...
                    }
                    ```

                    ---
                    - Apply summon function can be paired with Context Bounds

                    ```scala [1-10]
                    def safeMax[T: Comparator](list: List[T]) Option[T] =
                      list.foldLeft[Option[T]](None) {
                        case (Some(v1), v2) =>
                          val res = Comparator[T].compare(v1, v2) < 0
                          Some(if (res) v2 else v1)
                        case (None, v)      => Some(v)
                      }
                    ```
                    ---

                    - And Context Bounds can be paired with syntax extensions

                    ```scala [1-7]
                    implicit final class ComparatorOps[T](private val t: T)
                      extends AnyVal {

                      def compareTo(other: T)(implicit
                       comparator: Comparator[T]
                      ): Int = comparator.compare(t, other)
                    }
                    ```
                    ---
                    - No explicit call to instance of comparator

                    ```scala [1-10]
                    def safeMax[T: Comparator](list: List[T]) Option[T] =
                      list.foldLeft[Option[T]](None) {
                        case (Some(v1), v2) =>
                          val res = v1 compareTo v2 < 0
                          Some(if (res) v2 else v1)
                        case (None, v)      => Some(v)
                      }
                    ```
                    ---

                    - There are several usual ways to define the typeclass instances:
                    - In the companion object of the typeclass itself (useful for default instances)
                    - In the companion object of the type for which we define the instance

                    ---

                    ```scala [1-13]
                    trait Comparator[T] {
                      def compare(a: Int, b: Int): Int
                    }
                    object Comparator {
                      implicit val comparatorInt: Comparator[Int] =
                        (a, b) => a - b
                    }

                    case class User(rank: Int, username: String)
                    object User {
                      implicit val comparator: Comparator[User] =
                        (a, b) => a.rank - b.rank
                    }
                    ```

                    ---

                    - Both instances of `Comparator` for `Int` and `User` are in the global implicit scope
                    - We can use them everywhere we want

                    ```scala [1-8]
                    val one = implicitly[Comparator[Int]]
                      .compare(1, 2) // one = -1

                    val two = implicitly[Comparator[User]]
                      .compare(
                        User(1, "Vasya"),
                        User(2, "Petya")
                      ) // two = -1
                    ```

                    ---
                    - If the typeclass instance is not defined in the global implicit scope, then
                    it is called __orphan__
                    - Typical use case: define external typeclass instance for primitive types

                    ```scala [1-4]
                    object model {
                      implicit val comparatorString: Comparator[String] =
                        (a, b) => a.length - b.length
                    }
